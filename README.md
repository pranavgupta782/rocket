# rocket
A moving rocket in Racket using the teachpacks draw.rkt and arrow.rkt.

You can use this program in the DrRacket IDE. You will have to add the required teachpacks. You can then run the following commands in the 'Interactions' window:
1. (start 100 500)
2. (control-up-down ROCKET 100 move-lol draw-lol)

This will create a canvas of width 100 pixels and height 500 pixels. This will also create a graphical user interface that permits the user to move the rocket up and down by using the arrows.
